# Colors and Moodboard

This repository contains my work on a series of UI exercises focusing on colors, moodboards, typography, and replicating screens on Figma. The aim was to practice and enhance my skills in the following areas:

## UI Challenges

I worked on replicating several UI screens to practice my design skills. Here are some of the challenges included in this repository:

   - Flight UI Challenge

   - Spotify UI Challenge

   - Timer UI Challenge

   - Bitcoin Dashboard UI Challenge

   - Watches UI Challenge

## File Naming Convention

I followed a specific file naming convention to maintain consistency:
```
Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber.fig
```
For example: Allan_Kmaua_FlightUI_23012025_v1.fig
Tips and Resources

   - Use Figma's Color Pipette to extract colors.

  -  HSB & HSV values can be found depending on the source.

   - Ensure the final deliverables are clean, simple, and easy to read.

Resources I've used:

  -  Video tutorial on Figma

   - Beginning graphic design

  -  Gareth graphic
