# Atomic Design Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing the Atomic Design methodology to create and analyze UI components and design systems. The goal is to understand the structure of UI libraries and practice developing reusable components for real-world applications.

## Key Concepts

Atomic Design Methodology:

Breaking down UIs into fundamental building blocks:

Atoms: Basic elements like buttons, icons, or input fields.

Molecules: Combinations of atoms that work together, such as a search bar.

Organisms: Groups of molecules forming distinct sections, like a navigation bar.

Templates: Frameworks for page layouts.

Pages: Complete screens with actual content.

Material Design:

Analyzing the order of layers in UI screens and understanding visual hierarchies.

Design System Creation:

Building cohesive libraries for specific themes or brands by defining colors, typography, components, and multistate elements.

### Tasks Completed

1. Atomic Design Analysis

Snapshots were taken from Alibaba, Booking.com, EasyJet App, and Interrail to identify and categorize:

One Atom

One Molecule

One Organism

One Template

2. Material Design Layering

Using a snapshot of Lyft screens, the visual hierarchy was analyzed, and layers were ordered numerically to understand the stacking context.

3. Design System Exploration

A library of UI elements was recreated based on the EasyJet design system, including atoms, molecules, and organisms.

4. Climbing Group Rebrand

A moodboard was created with pictures, colors, and typography reflecting the climbing theme.

A design system was developed with:

Atoms, molecules, and organisms.

Multistate components for interactivity and variations.

5. Dating App Design

A moodboard was composed with romantic, vibrant colors and typography.

A complete design system was built, featuring components tailored for a dating app UI.

### Tools & Resources

Figma: Used to create moodboards, design systems, and analyze UI elements.

Noun Project: Source of icons for UI components.
