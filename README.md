# Piscine-UI Repository

Piscine-UI is a repository dedicated to UI/UX design exercises, focusing on building foundational and advanced skills in user interface design using Figma. The repository is divided into five folders, each containing tasks and projects related to specific aspects of UI/UX design. Each folder includes deliverables designed to enhance understanding of UI design aspects.

## Task Progression

### 1. colors-and-moodboard (currently working on this task)

This task contains exercises related to understanding and applying color palettes, creating moodboards, and exploring color combinations. Tasks include:

Extracting color palettes from popular websites.

Creating moodboards based on design briefs.

Experimenting with color combinations like monochromatic, complementary, and triadic.

### Sample Task:

Find the Colors: Extract 3-4 main colors from the homepages of websites like Komoot, Airtable, and more.

Deliverables: Figma file with screenshots, URLs, extracted colors, and matching color codes.

### Pending Tasks

These tasks will begin after completing colors-and-moodboard:

### 2. Atomic-design

This task will explore the principles of atomic design and how to create scalable design systems using atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

### 3. Building an Interface

This task will focus on designing complete user interfaces from scratch, applying principles learned in previous tasks.

### 4. Rules

This task will establish design rules and guidelines to maintain consistency and usability across UI designs.

### 5. Heuristics

This task will involve evaluating designs based on usability heuristics and principles, ensuring designs meet user needs effectively.
